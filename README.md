## Exploratory-data-analysis-EDA-with-pandas-in-banking

## Introduction

The purpose of this project is to conduct the exploratory data analysis (EDA) in banking using Pandas framework.

During this project we will do the following

 *   Explore a banking dataset with Pandas framework.
 *   Build pivot tables.
 *   Visualize the dataset with various plot types.

## Objectives

In this project, we will try to give answers to a set of questions that may be relevant when analyzing banking data:

   *  What is the share of clients attracted in our source data?
   *  What are the mean values of numerical features among the attracted clients?
   *  What is the average call duration for the attracted clients?
   *  What is the average age among the attracted and unmarried clients?
   *  What is the average age and call duration for different types of client employment?
   
   
## Code and Resources used

**Python Version**:3.9.12 

**Packages**:pandas,numpy,matplotlib

**Data Source**:https://archive.ics.uci.edu

## Data Collection
The datasets used in this project were downloaded from https://archive.ics.uci.edu.
I then read the csv files using the pd.read_csv() command.

## Data Cleaning 
The data did not require any type of cleaning. There were no missing values and the data was of the correct type.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
I looked at different distributions for both the numeric and categorical data. Below are highlights from the data visualization section
